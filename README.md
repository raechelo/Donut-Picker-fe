# Palette-Picker
Check the live app out (here)[]!

With Palette-Picker, a user can create new projects with unique names and create new colorful palettes! If the user likes the palette, they can then save it to a project of their choice, or if they only like a select few colors, they can 'lock' those colors into place and randomize for new colors to match! Should a user decide to, they can go back to a previously saved palette and update it with new colors! They can also delete any palettes or projects they've changed their mind about.

Final Product

## Learning Goals

Palette Picker is a project designed for developers to use multiple environments including the development, testing, and continuous integration environments, as well as solidify their knowledge of server-side testing and connecting a front and backend with CORS.

Additionally, this project was intended for students to really dive deep into utilizing issues, templates, and code reviews to effectively collaborate on a project and to mimic a real-world environment. (Another environment! 💪)
